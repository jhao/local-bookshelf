- A dashboard combining visual analytics with card-based collection management.
- Multi-path collection creation with automatic metadata enrichment (classification, ISBN, publication year, cover art).
- Rich browsing with search, tree-filtered classifications, pagination, and card/table layouts.
- A universal reader that previews common ebook formats, exports to PDF, and provides configurable text-to-speech.
- AI-assisted conversations grounded in the contents of each collection.
